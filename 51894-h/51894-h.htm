<h1>Stamp Taxes on Drafts, Checks
and Promissory Notes<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h1>

<p>The Revenue Act of 1918 imposes a tax
on drafts and checks, payable otherwise
than at sight or on demand, upon their acceptance
or delivery, whichever is prior, within
the territorial jurisdiction of the United
States, and on promissory notes, except those
listed below as exempt, and on each renewal
of the same. The term “United States” includes
the states, the District of Columbia,
Hawaii and Alaska.</p>

<p>The tax is at the rate of 2 cents on each
$100 or fractional part thereof. On amounts
not in excess of $100 the tax is 2 cents.</p>

<p>Any instrument or writing operating as a
renewal of a promissory note is taxable, but the
mere suspension of payment or forbearance
does not constitute a taxable renewal within
the meaning of the law, nor does payment
of interest on a demand note, without
any agreement in writing extending the note.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
The payment, however, of interest in advance,
after maturity of a promissory note, evidenced
by an indorsement, constitutes a taxable
renewal.</p>

<p>Liability to tax and the amount thereof,
is determined by the form and face of a check
or draft and cannot be affected by proof of
facts or instructions outside of the instrument.
Payment for the stamp is a matter for adjustment
between the parties, but obligation
rests upon the drawee, payee, or indorsee of
a draft to see that the tax is paid before or
at the time of acceptance or delivery and both
parties to a promissory note are responsible
for affixing and cancelling stamps in the required
amount.</p>

<h2>Checks and Drafts</h2>

<p>The following instruments payable otherwise
than at sight or on demand are included
among taxable drafts and checks:</p>

<p><span class="number">8.</span> Time drafts drawn against shipments from the

Islands, the Philippines and Porto Rico.</p>

<p><span class="number">4.</span> Time drafts directly covering exports to a foreign
country, and constituting an inherent,
necessary and bona fide part of the actual
process of exportation.</p>

<p><span class="number">5.</span> Time drafts drawn on domestic banks against
export shipments delivered to the first carrier
for transportation, covering the period of
transit from the interior point to the seaboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="number">6.</span> Drafts drawn abroad on a foreign drawee with

agent of the payee within the United States.</p>

</div>

<h2>Promissory Notes</h2>

<p>The following promissory notes and renewals
of the same are included among instruments
taxable:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="number">1.</span> Notes given for security only.</p>

<p><span class="number">2.</span> Notes payable on demand or after date.</p>

<p><span class="number">3.</span> Promissory notes accompanying mortgages of

<p><span class="number">6.</span> Extensions or renewals of promissory notes
brought about by extension of mortgages by
which such notes are secured.</p>

<p><span class="number">7.</span> Instruments in the form of promissory notes,
representing the interest upon promissory
notes, not included under (6) below, and either
separate from or prepared in a form and for
the purpose of being separated from the
principal note.</p>

<p><span class="number">8.</span> Policy loan and premium extension agreements
containing an unqualified promise to pay a
specified sum of money at a certain date, except
where the sole remedy of the payee in case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of non-payment of the premiums or loans is to
reduce or cancel the rights of the insured.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="number">6.</span> Coupons and interest notes which are attached
to a principal obligation and are substantially
repetitions of the promise to pay interest contained
in the principal obligation.</p>

<p><span class="number">7.</span> Promissory notes secured by United States
bonds or obligations issued after April 24,
1917 or secured by the pledge of a promissory
note which itself is secured by the pledge of
such bonds or obligations. Such bonds must
have a par value of not less than the amount
of such notes to exempt the latter.</p>

</div>

<h2>Cancellation of Stamps</h2>

<p>Any person using or affixing stamps must
so deface the same as to render them unfit
for further use by writing or stamping his
initials and the date thereon with ink, or by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
cutting and canceling such stamp with a
machine or punch, which will affix the initials
and date. The cancellation should not so deface
the stamp as to prevent its denomination
and genuineness from being readily determined.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, stamps of the
value of 10 cents or more must have three
parallel incisions made by some sharp instrument
lengthwise through the stamp after the
same has been attached to the document, except
where the stamps are cancelled by perforation.</p>

<h2>Use of Cancelled Stamps&mdash;Refunds</h2>

<p>A stamp affixed to an instrument and cancelled
cannot lawfully be removed and attached
to another instrument. Refund will
be made by the collector of internal revenue
for amounts paid for stamps used in excess
of requirements, or on instruments not actually
effective and for which a substitute is
prepared and stamped, or on instruments not
subject to tax.</p>
